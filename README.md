# Generalized-Additive-Models-for-Location-Scale-and-Shape-GAMLSS-
Using R code
It is a statistical framework that has great flexibility and power. Some benefits include flexibility in distribution, modelling resulting into multiple parameters, also works  well with non-linear relationships of variables and handles heterogeneity. However, it also comes with some disadvantages, such as complexity, interpretability and software availability 

In this modelling, GAMLSS is used to model the effect of number of seizures episodes (n_epil), medication adherence (adh), and number of medications taken (n_med) on quality of life (qol) of epilepsy patients
